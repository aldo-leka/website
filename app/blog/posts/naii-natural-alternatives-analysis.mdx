# NAII - Natural Alternatives International, Inc.

Natural Alternatives International, Inc. engages in formulating, manufacturing, and marketing nutritional supplements such as vitamins, minerals, herbal, and other nutritional supplements, as well as other health care products in the United States, Europe, Australia, Asia, Mexico, and Canada.

## Revenue and Operating Margins Analysis

![NAII Revenue and Operating Margins](/images/naii-revenue-margins-placeholder.png)

The chart shows revenues in blue, operating margins as a line (not that great as max is 12.5% and average is probably at around 4% or so), and EBIT excl. unusual items.

Key observations:
- Operating margins have fluctuated between 3% and 12.5%
- Recent margin compression in 2023 to 3% from 8% in the prior year
- Revenue trends remain relatively stable despite margin pressure

## Equity Growth and Capital Allocation

The chart shows a growth of equity with compound annual growth rate of ~8%.

### Share Structure and Capital Management

There are 6M shares outstanding. Due to share repurchases, this amount has been lowered in the last 5 years from 7.5M (2018 10-K). This represents a meaningful reduction in share count of 20%, benefiting existing shareholders.

Capital structure highlights:
- Additional paid-in capital: $31.4M
- Retained earnings: $80.1M
- This suggests good profitability and disciplined use of capital over time

## Valuation Disconnect

For this company, the equity value and the stock price aren't very in tune. It seems like it follows the last year margins more or less, which have been low for 2023 at 3% vs 8% one year ago. This creates a potential opportunity for value investors who can look beyond short-term margin compression.

## Business Model and Customer Concentration

NAII serves primarily 3 customers for manufacturing the supplements. While this concentration presents some risk, it also demonstrates:
- Strong customer relationships
- Specialized manufacturing capabilities
- Barriers to entry for competitors

## Balance Sheet Strength

All in all, this company seems to be doing good. Balance sheet metrics are particularly strong:

- Book value: $88.8M
- Cash position: $16.7M
- Debt: No credit facility (debt-free)
- Current ratio: 3.6x
- Quick ratio: 1.32x

These metrics indicate a fortress balance sheet with ample liquidity and no financial distress risk.

## Investment Thesis

Current market dynamics:
- Market capitalization: $40M
- Share price: $6.61
- Price-to-book ratio: 0.45x (trading at less than half of book value)

I purchased this stock for $6.40 a month or so ago. Given:
- The significant discount to book value
- Strong balance sheet with net cash position
- History of profitable operations
- Active share buyback program

I wouldn't sell for less than a double of my investment, and I consider this a good investment based on the analysis done so far.

## Management Alignment

The CEO, who has been a director since 1986, owns directly and indirectly 0.7M shares (Form 4, SEC), which represents almost 12% of the common shares outstanding. This significant insider ownership aligns management interests with shareholders and suggests confidence in the company's long-term prospects.

## Risks to Consider

1. Customer concentration (3 primary customers)
2. Operating margin volatility
3. Competitive pressures in the supplements industry
4. Raw material cost inflation

## Conclusion

NAII represents a classic value investment opportunity - a profitable company with a strong balance sheet trading at a significant discount to book value. While near-term margins have compressed, the long-term fundamentals remain intact, and patient investors may be rewarded as the market recognizes the underlying value.
