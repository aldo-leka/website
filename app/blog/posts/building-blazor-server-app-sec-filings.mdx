# Building a Blazor Server App for SEC Filings

When I set out to build SuperInvestor, I had a clear goal: create a tool that would make it easier for investors to analyze SEC filings. After spending countless hours copying and pasting text from EDGAR into various note-taking apps, I knew there had to be a better way.

## Why Blazor Server?

I chose Blazor Server for several reasons:

1. **Real-time updates**: Blazor Server's SignalR connection enables real-time collaboration features
2. **Server-side rendering**: Perfect for text-heavy SEC filings without large client-side payloads
3. **.NET ecosystem**: Leverages existing .NET libraries for parsing XBRL and other financial formats
4. **Security**: Sensitive financial data stays on the server

## Technical Architecture

The application follows a clean architecture pattern with these main components:

### Data Layer
- SQL Server database for storing user notes and filing metadata
- Entity Framework Core for data access
- Background services for fetching new filings from EDGAR

### Business Logic
- Services for parsing SEC filings (10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, etc.)
- Full-text search implementation using SQL Server Full-Text Search
- Note synchronization logic for real-time collaboration

### Presentation Layer
- Blazor Server components for the UI
- Custom JavaScript interop for highlighting and annotation features
- Responsive design that works on tablets for reading on the go

## Key Features Implementation

### Shareable Links

One of the most requested features was the ability to share annotated filings. I implemented this using:

```csharp
public class ShareService
{
    public string GenerateShareableLink(int filingId, List<int> noteIds)
    {
        var token = GenerateSecureToken();
        // Store token with associated filing and notes
        return $"https://app.getsuperinvestor.com/shared/{token}";
    }
}
```

### Real-time Collaboration

Using Blazor's built-in SignalR connection, implementing real-time features was straightforward:

```csharp
protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
{
    hubConnection = new HubConnectionBuilder()
        .WithUrl(NavigationManager.ToAbsoluteUri("/filinghub"))
        .Build();
        
    hubConnection.On<Note>("ReceiveNote", (note) =>
    {
        notes.Add(note);
        InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
    });
    
    await hubConnection.StartAsync();
}
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Blazor Server works great for document-heavy applications** - The server-side rendering is perfect for displaying large SEC filings without downloading megabytes to the client.

2. **SignalR scaling requires planning** - As the user base grew, I had to implement Redis backplane for SignalR to work across multiple servers.

3. **Background services are essential** - Fetching and processing SEC filings in the background keeps the UI responsive.

## What's Next

I'm currently working on:
- AI-powered insights to highlight important sections
- Export functionality for investment reports
- Mobile app using .NET MAUI

Building SuperInvestor has been an incredible journey. It's satisfying to create a tool that saves hours of manual work for investors. If you're interested in the technical details or want to contribute, check out the project at [getsuperinvestor.com](https://www.getsuperinvestor.com).
